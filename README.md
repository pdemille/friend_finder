Friends.js

The initial database for my objects to go into aka my future matches

Home.html

The main home page

Survey.html

Will be the page used to retrieve user data, save those results, store them via API, and then able to be used when called upon (or when matches allow it).

Initially the user will answer questions 1 - 10 stored as inputs

Once the submit button is clicked, the AJAX call will post the user data. This data is readable through parsing. The match name and match image are then shown to the user by pinging the API route. The user's information is now also stores within the API.

Server.js

Is ultimately used for hosting the domain and url. It also used the parsing to allow data to be readable for the server.
